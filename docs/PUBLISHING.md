# Publishing

There aren't any very restrictive guidelines for publishing a project under us however:
- You have to follow the commit message convention if your project is a sub-project. (e.g AOSP device tree, Linux source)
- or if it's OC, follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
- You and your project shouldn't have anything that violates the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/FairDeviceFOSS/.github/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

- # Applying
- - Start a new issue [here](https://github.com/FairDeviceFOSS/org-board/issues/new).
  - Follow this [format](https://github.com/FairDeviceFOSS/org-board/issues/1)
  - or, if its a device tree, follow [this format](https://github.com/FairDeviceFOSS/org-board/issues/2)
